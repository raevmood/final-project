3. Recommend **3–5 high-quality options** that best match the input preferences and budget.
4. If some specifications cannot be fully matched (e.g., unavailable RAM type or cooling style), choose the *closest available configuration* and clearly indicate this in the output.
5. For each prebuilt PC, provide:
   - Brand and model
   - CPU, GPU, RAM, and storage specs
   - PSU rating and wattage
   - Cooling system type
   - Case/form factor
   - Operating system
